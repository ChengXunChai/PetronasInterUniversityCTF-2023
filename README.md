# Petronas Inter-University CTF 2023 Writeups

Welcome to my Petronas Inter-University CTF 2023 writeups! ðŸŽ‰

## My Approach

As a passionate cybersecurity enthusiast, I approach the Petronas Inter-University CTF 2023 with the following goals:

- **Learn:** Every challenge is an opportunity to learn something new, whether it's a new technique, tool, or concept.
- **Collaborate:** I enjoy collaborating with fellow participants to share insights and knowledge, making the journey more enriching.
- **Document:** I'll be writing detailed writeups for the challenges I solve, helping others and reinforcing my own understanding.

## Writeups

Please note that this repository does not include all the challenges from the competition, but a sub-set of those that I have downloaded or solved. Some challenges, such as web challenges that provided external weblinks, are not included as they are no longer be accessible.

## My Team 

My team, CTRL+SHIFT+HACKERS, consist of Jaythan Chew Kam Wye, Nicholas Chong Wei Chen, Swee Hao Feng, and me.
